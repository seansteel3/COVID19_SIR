  The COVID19_SIR project is a mathematical modeling project for the spread of COVID-19. 
This project aims to explore disease dynamics through a basic epidemiological compartmental model known as the Survival Infectious
Recovered Deceased model, or SIRD for short. 
  This model builds off the basic SIR (Survival Infectious Recovered/Removed) model by specifying
a compartment for deceased individuals as opposed to simply lumping removed and recovered together. 
Due to the fact COVID-19 is a rapidly evolving public health crisis, the data surrounding current infections may not be accurate, 
and the error in reporting infections is likely to be highly heteroskedastic. However, death data, while still prone to error, 
is less likely to be critically compromised like infection data. Under this context SIRD model is considered a more simple model 
than the basic SIR model, since death data to fit directly to estimate the parameters.
  In addition to the obvious intrigue of exploring the nature of pandemics, this project is also intended as a personal 
learning project since it will serve as the first exposure to differential equation modeling.
